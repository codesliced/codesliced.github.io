<a name="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jr. Full Stack Web Developer</h3>

<p>Hi! I'm a photographer/designer who has become smitten with writing code, and I'm looking for a Junior Full Stack Web Developer position.</p>

<p>The work happening at tech companies excites me so much that I left my comfort zone as a photographer and marketing specialist to attend Dev Bootcamp, an intense nine-week full-time training for full-stack developers.</p>

<p>In addition to computer science fundamentals, Ruby, JavaScript, and MVC frameworks, we learned pair programming, engineering empathy, Git, Scrum, and how to be better members of teams.</p>

<p>Now that I've completed the program, I am eager to join a team that is passionate about building software that makes the world a better place.</p>

<ul><li><h4>Hospitally</h4>
Hospitals charge drastically different amounts for the same procedure. Our team of four Dev Bootcamp apprentices combined the recently released Medicare chargemaster data with government measures of quality such as patient survey results, geocoded 3k hospital addresses, and mapped the results with Google Maps. We wanted to make the data more accessible to the public and promote a discussion of the burgeoning cost of healthcare in the US.<div class="links"><a href="https://github.com/Ank13/ops_hospital_mapper" target="_blank">Repo</a> | <a href="http://hospital-mapper.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Launch site</a></div></li>
 
</ul>

<ul><li><h4>PhotoOverflow</h4>
PhotoOverflow is a StackOverflow clone geared towards photographers who want to get helpful advice from other photographers. The web app was built using Ruby on Rails, CarrierWave, Amazon S3, Bootstrap, and memcache.<div class="links"><a href="https://github.com/codesliced/ask-about-photos" target="_blank">Repo</a> | <a href="http://ask-about-photos.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Launch site</a></div>
</li></ul>

<ul><li><h4>Interview with Stephen</h4>
Technical Interview Practice with Stephen Hawking was built during an 8-hour hackathon in Chicago. Our team of four used Ruby on Rails, text to speech, and Nokogiri.<div class="links"><a href="https://github.com/JasonBenn/interview_with_steve_hawking/" target="_blank">Repo</a> | <a href="http://interview-with-stephen.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">launch site</a></div></li></ul>

<p>Anonymous feedback from my pair programming partners:

<ul><li>"Thanks for being a great partner! Your enthusiasm and curiosity are infectious, and your drive pushes me to work harder and figure things out. You ask pointed questions, and that's a good thing. You are patient and optimistic."</li>
<li>"You were an excellent partner to pair with, and I felt like we made good headway on the challenges that we worked on together. I felt respected by you and comfortable sharing my ideas with you. It seemed like you were comfortable asking for help when you needed it, which is another positive sign."</li></ul>
